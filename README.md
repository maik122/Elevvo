# Elevvo Internship â€“ Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains the machine learning projects I completed during my internship at **Elevvo**. The projects cover a wide range of practical machine learning applications, including regression, classification, clustering, recommendation systems, time series forecasting, and computer vision.

Each project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets, implement machine learning algorithms, perform data analysis, and evaluate model performance effectively.

## Projects Overview

### Student Score Prediction
- Built a model to predict student exam scores based on study habits and other factors.
- Performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations to understand key patterns.
- Implemented **linear and polynomial regression**, evaluated model performance, and visualized predictions.

### Customer Segmentation
- Clustered customers based on income and spending score to identify patterns in consumer behaviour.
- Applied **K-Means clustering**, scaled features, and visualized clusters.
- Experimented with different features and analyzed average spending per cluster.

### Forest Cover Type Classification
- Classified forest cover types using cartographic and environmental features.
- Trained and compared **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** models for multi-class classification.
- Evaluated models using metrics and visualized feature importance.

### Loan Approval Prediction
- Predicted loan approval outcomes based on applicant data.
- Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and addressed imbalanced data.
- Evaluated models using precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability.

### Movie Recommendation System
- Developed a recommendation system to suggest movies based on user similarity.
- Built a **user-item matrix**, computed similarity scores, and recommended top-rated unseen movies.
- Explored collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques.

### Music Genre Classification
- Classified songs into genres using extracted audio features and spectrogram images.
- Implemented **multi-class models** with tabular data and CNNs for image-based classification.
- Experimented with transfer learning to improve accuracy.

### Sales Forecasting
- Predicted future sales based on historical sales data.
- Created time-based features, applied regression models, and visualized predicted vs actual sales.
- Explored advanced techniques such as rolling averages and XGBoost for time-aware forecasting.

### Traffic Sign Recognition
- Built a CNN model to classify traffic signs from images.
- Preprocessed and augmented images to improve model performance.
- Compared custom CNN architectures with pre-trained models like MobileNet.
